**KMP FatFramework Cocoa** is a Gradle plugin for Kotlin Multiplatform projects that generates a **FatFramework** for iOS targets, or a **XCFramework**
for Apple targets and manages the publishing process in a CocoaPod Repository.

## Installation

The library is uploaded on MavenCentral, so you can easily add the dependency on the `plugins` block:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.prof18.kmp.fatframework.cocoa") version "<latest-version>"
}
```

## Usage

The plugin adds five Gradle tasks to your project.

- `buildDebugIosFatFramework` that creates a **FatFramework** with the `Debug` target.


- `buildDebugXCFramework` that creates a **XCFramework** with the `Debug` target.


- `buildReleaseIosFatFramework` that creates a **FatFramework** with the `Release` target.


- `buildReleaseXCFramework` that creates a **XCFramework** with the `Release` target.


- `generateCocoaPodRepo` that generates a CocoaPod repository ready to host the Framework.


- `publishDebugIosFatFramework` that publishes the `Debug` version of the **FatFramework** in the CocoaPod repository.


- `publishDebugXCFramework` that publishes the `Debug` version of the **XCFramework** in the CocoaPod repository.
  <br><br>
  The "publishDebug" task (for both the type of frameworks) takes care of everything:
  - changing the working branch from main/master to develop;
  - building the debug framework;
  - updating the version name inside the Podspec file;
  - committing the changes;
  - and publishing to remote.

  In this way, in the iOS project, you can use the latest changes published on the develop branch:

  ```ruby
  pod '<your-library-name>', :git => "git@github.com:<git-username>/<repo-name>.git", :branch => 'develop'
  ```
  To run this task, the output path provided in the [configuration](#configuration) must be a git repository.


- `publishReleaseIosFatFramework` that publishes the `Release` version of the **FatFramework** in the CocoaPod repository.


- `publishReleaseXCFramework` that publishes the `Release` version of the **XCFramework** in the CocoaPod repository.
  <br><br>
  The "publishRelease" task (for both the type of frameworks) takes care of everything:
  - changing the working branch from develop to main/master;
  - building the release framework;
  - updating the version name inside the Podspec file;
  - committing the changes;
  - tagging the commit;
  - and publishing to remote.

  In this way, in the iOS project, you have to specify a version:

  ```ruby
  pod '<your-library-name>', :git => "git@github.com:<git-username>/<repo-name>.git", :tag => '<version-number>'
  ```

  To run this task, the output path provided in the [configuration](#configuration) must be a git repository.

## Configuration

You can configure the plugin with the `fatFrameworkCocoaConfig` block in your `build.gradle[.kts]`.

The mandatory fields are three:

- the name of the FatFramework
- the output path
- the version name
- For XCFramework support, you need to set the `useXCFramework` flag. When the flag is set, only the XCFramework task can be called.

```kotlin
fatFrameworkCocoaConfig {
    frameworkName = "LibraryName"
    outputPath = "$rootDir/../test-dest"
    versionName = "1.0"
    useXCFramework = true
}
```

When using a FatFramework, only iOS targets can be packed together. With XCFramework you can pack together all the Apple families: iOS, macOS, etc.

If you want to run the `generateCocoaPodRepo` task to generate a CocoaPod repository, you have to
provide the mandatory fields mentioned above and some other parameters in the `cocoaPodRepoInfo` block:

- a summary of the library
- the homepage of the library
- the license of the library
- the authors of the library
- the url of the git repository that hosts the CocoaPod repo.

```kotlin
fatFrameworkCocoaConfig {
    frameworkName = "LibraryName"
    outputPath = "$rootDir/../test-dest"
    versionName = "1.0"

    cocoaPodRepoInfo {
        summary = "This is a test KMP framework"
        homepage = "https://github.com/prof18/ccoca-repo-test"
        license = "Apache"
        authors = "\"Marco Gomiero\" => \"mg@mail.it\""
        gitUrl = "git@github.com:prof18/ccoca-repo-test.git"
    }
}
```

## Changelog

- The version `0.2.1` introduce some breaking changes to better support XCFrameworks. Give a look to the [0.2.1 release notes](https://github.com/prof18/kmp-fatframework-cocoa/releases/tag/0.2.1).

## Sample Project

To see the plugin in action, I've published [a little sample project](https://github.com/prof18/kmp-fatframework-test-project).

## Further Readings

This plugin is born from a set of unbundled Gradle tasks that I was copying between every Kotlin Multiplatform project.
I've written about these
tasks [in an article on my website](https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/kmp-existing-project/).
